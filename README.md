# Whales Portfolio Analysis

![](qa.png)

This analysis allows you to take on the role of a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios. To keep the costs low, the firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.

You've been tasked with evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. You’ll need to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, sharpe ratios, and betas.
